                      <p>
                        I&rsquo;m Arshad Qadri, a dedicated React developer with
                        over 3.5 years of experience and a BCA degree from
                        Shivaji University, Kolhapur (2020). I specialize in
                        building fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly web
                        applications using React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, and
                        TypeScript. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                        Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Reactstrap for UI
                        development, along with Redux for efficient state
                        management. I also have backend experience using
                        Node.js, Express, and working with databases like
                        MongoDB and MySQL. Passionate about clean code,
                        performance, and user experience, I enjoy contributing
                        to modern web projects that solve real-world problems.
